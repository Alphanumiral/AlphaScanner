Another scanner for Genshin Impact!

Install Guide:
1: download and extract the zip from the releases section
2: run alphascanner.exe AS ADMINISTRATOR, automatically clicking through your inventory will not work if you do not run as administrator

Usage Guide:
Scanning currently on screen item:
Click the "scan current <x>" button while on the corresponding item and wait a second or so


Mass scanning your inventory:
BE ON THE PAIMON MENU THE APPEARS WHEN YOU PRESS "ESCAPE" DURING GAMEPLAY
Check every tickbox for the items you want and fill in the corresponding information
Click the "Begin Mass Scan" button

Achievements:
Optionally can merge with paimon.moe data. This is useful if you want to import your achievements while retaining your wish history, since uploading just the achievements would otherwise overwrite it

Characters:
Entering your Traveler's and Wanderer's name is important since otherwise it will scan as whatever custom name you wrote. If you do not own Wanderer leaving that blank is ok.

Weapon/Artifacts:
Rarity limiter will stop the scan once it has passed all of the rarities you care about. The caveat here is that your secondary sorting rule must be set to quality, otherwise if you have 4 star artifacts leveled they will be placed ahead of unleveled 5 star artifacts.


Obtaining your data:
Once all your desired scan results are complete, hit the "Export Data To File" button and it will create a folder in the alphascanner directory called ScanData containing your file.
If you have achievements selected alongside the rest of the scan options, it will create 2 files since you will be uploading achievements to a separate website.
